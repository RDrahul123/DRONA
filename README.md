# Project Drona (Bomb Detection)

## Introduction

The military has been at the forefront of deploying machines to overcome the risks associated with human-led landmine detection processes. Our project, Drona, aims to integrate and evaluate a set of low-cost technologies to autonomously detect explosive landmines without compromising mission safety. Our goal includes detecting both fully visible and partially buried landmines, utilizing fully autonomous systems that don't require human intervention for monitoring detection and deactivation.

### Project Benefits

1. Easy Bomb or Landmine Location
2. Autonomous Handling
3. Simple Detonation Process
4. Remote Control
5. Ideal for Patrolling
6. Restricted Remote Access (Not globally accessible)

## Project Scope

1. Detection and Detonation without Human Intervention
2. Large Sector Area Patrolling
3. Utilizing Low-cost Technologies

## Problem Statement

Explosive landmines have claimed numerous lives worldwide, prompting the need for safer detection methods. Can we overcome this with advanced technology?

## Objectives

1. Integration and evaluation of low-cost technologies
2. Detection of visible and partially buried landmines
3. Implementation of fully autonomous systems for detection and deactivation

## Intended User

Defense systems and local police departments.

## Existing Systems

1. Drone designed by Harshwardhan Zala for landmine detection and detonation.
2. Spectro Drone by Laser Detect Systems, Israel.
3. Raider-X by DRDO and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

## Proposed System

We propose a drone equipped with RADAR for bomb detection, capable of operating up to 15 km range. The drone is waterproof, operates in darkness, and includes GPS locator and automatic return functionality. Additionally, it features a wireless camera with servo motor for wide area coverage.
